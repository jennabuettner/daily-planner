# Daily Planner
This project's purpose is to create a web application that is a daily task manager within normal business hours that a user can utilize to organize their to-do tasks.

## Description
 The web application is a visual of one day's business hours in order of the hour . Each row has the hour, a text area for the task at hand, and a save button. The user will also be able to tell by color whether the hour is of the past, present, or future, and save their task list on the web page even after the page is reloaded.
